## Frequently asked questions

#### How is `react-window` different from `react-virtualized`?
I wrote `react-virtualized` several years ago. At the time, I was new to both React and the concept of windowing. Because of this, I made a few API decisions that I later came to regret. One of these was adding too many non-essential features and components. Once you add something to an open source project, removing it is pretty painful for users.

`react-window` is a complete rewrite of `react-virtualized`. I didn't try to solve as many problems or support as many use cases. Instead I focused on making the package **smaller**<sup>1</sup> and **faster**. I also put a lot of thought into making the API (and documentation) as beginner-friendly as possible (with the caveat that windowing is still kind of an advanced use case).

If `react-window` provides the functionality your project needs, I would strongly recommend using it instead of `react-virtualized`. However if you need features that only `react-virtualized` provides, you have two options:

1. Use `react-virtualized`. (It's still widely used by a lot of successful projects!)
2. Create a component that decorates one of the `react-window` primitives and adds the functionality you need. You may event want to release this component to NPM (as its own, standalone package)! ðŸ™‚

<sup>1 - Adding a `react-virtualized` list to a CRA project increases the (gzipped) build size by ~33.5 KB. Adding a `react-window` list to a CRA project increases the (gzipped) build size by &lt;2 KB.</sup>
